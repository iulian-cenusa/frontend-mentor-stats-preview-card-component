## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I want to challenge me to finish this project as soon as possible. It took me around 2 hours to finish.

### Continued development

Though the project was finished quick, it's not done. It could be improved.

### Useful resources

- [Css mix-blend-mode property](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_mix-blend-mode.asp) - This helped me to create a color overlay to the images.
